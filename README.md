## About Chamaa

Chamaa is a revolutionary DApp built on the Celo Blockchain, inspired by the traditional African Chama model. It aims to empower communities globally by providing a decentralized platform for collaborative social savings.

With a focus on financial inclusion, Chamaa utilizes the stablecoin cUSD to offer a stable and accessible currency, making it a hedge against inflation, especially in African countries. The app is designed to be inclusive, leveraging Minipay on the Opera Mini browser for usability in low-data network environments. Chamaa is not just a financial tool; it's a community-driven initiative fostering economic empowerment and resilience.

Celo Composer is built on Celo to make it simple to build dApps using a variety of front-end frameworks, and libraries.

- [Celo](https://celo.org/)
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

SocialConnect is an open source protocol that maps off-chain personal identifiers (such as phone numbers, twitter handles, etc.) to on-chain account addresses. This enables a convenient and interoperable user experience for use cases such as:

- payments - send money directly to your friend's phone number!
- social discovery - find someone's account based on their twitter!
- any other identity applications!
